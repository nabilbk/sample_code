#What follows is a class for the heap data structure. A "heap" is a binary tree where the value of the
#left child of any node in the tree is less than or equal to the value of the parent node, and the value of the right
#child of any node in the tree is greater than or equal to the value of the parent node. 
#
# The class contains functions to INITIALIZE, INSERT, DELETE elements into a heap
